                <p>
                    When you paste text into the editor, it may retain the copied styles from the source. If you prefer plain text, simply select the pasted content and click the 
                    <strong><i>T<sub>x</sub></i></strong> (Remove Formatting) icon. This will strip the text of any styling, leaving it plain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to use different font sizes, you can easily adjust them using the editor tools. However, if you are working with ruled paper, avoid using multiple font sizes as this may cause alignment issues. To prevent such problems, consider using a blank background instead of ruled paper.

                <p>
                    To ensure your handwritten text aligns perfectly with the paper background, you can adjust the following settings:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Input Line Spacing:</strong> Adjust the spacing between the lines of your text.</li>
                    <li><strong>Paper Line Spacing:</strong> Modify the spacing between the lines on the paper background.</li>
                    <li><strong>Left Margin Width:</strong> Increase or decrease the space on the left margin.</li>
                    <li><strong>Top Margin Height:</strong> Adjust the space at the top margin of the paper.</li>
                    <li><strong>Input Top Margin:</strong> Fine-tune the alignment between the bottom of the top margin and the text.</li>
                    <li><strong>Input Left Margin:</strong> Adjust the alignment of the text from the left margin of the paper.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you want to use a blank background, click the "Remove Background Lines" option. Additionally, if you do not wish to use left and top margins, you can simply disable them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also upload a custom background. If the background is blank, there will be no issues. However, when using a ruled background:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Resize the page to ensure the background fits completely inside the box.</li>
                    <li>Enable the background lines and align them with the ruled lines of your custom background.</li>
                    <li>After alignment, turn off the background lines, and you can now use your ruled paper background seamlessly.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="content-font">
                <h2>Font and Text Adjustments</h2>
                <p>
                    You can easily adjust the font size of your text using the <strong>Font Size</strong> option. Additionally, you can change the font size of specific parts of the text using the editor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The editor also allows you to customize the appearance of your text. You can:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Change the color</strong> of the font to match your preferences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Highlight</strong> text to make it stand out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply formatting</strong> like <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, and other styles as needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Additionally, you can adjust <strong>letter spacing</strong>, <strong>word spacing</strong>, and other spacing options to fine-tune the appearance of your text.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="content-effects">
                <h2>Shadow Effect Adjustment</h2>
                <p>
                    You can easily turn the shadow effect on or off according to your preference. Simply toggle the setting to apply or remove the shadow effect from your text.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="content-general">
                <p>
                    When adjusting the spacing, ensure that the <strong>input line spacing</strong> and <strong>paper line spacing</strong> are either the same or in a proper ratio to each other. This ensures that the text aligns properly with the paper lines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is not recommended to use different font sizes when working with ruled paper, as this may cause alignment issues and disrupt the overall appearance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To style text in the left and top margins where only plain text is allowed, first apply all desired styling, such as color changes, formatting, or layout adjustments, in the main container. Once the text is styled as needed, you can copy the styled version from the main container and then paste  into the margins. This ensures that the text is visually aligned with your intended design while adhering to the plain-text restrictions in the margins.

                <h2>Adding Math or Other Equations</h2>
                <p>
                    To add math or other equations, you need to use <strong>LaTeX</strong>. LaTeX is a powerful tool for formatting complex equations, and you can easily find resources online to learn more about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The easiest way to generate LaTeX code is by using AI tools like ChatGPT. For example, you can ask: 
                    <em>"Give a complex example equation and its LaTeX format."</em> Once you have the LaTeX code, enclose it within <code>$...$</code> and paste it into the editor. Your math equation will be added automatically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, you can use the editor's built-in <strong>f<sub>x</sub></strong> (Equation) icon. Paste the LaTeX code into the equation input field and click <strong>Save</strong>. Ensure that the LaTeX code is written in a single line for proper rendering.
                </p>
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>Here’s an example of a complex equation and its LaTeX format:</p>
                <p><strong>Equation:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Quadratic formula: <em>x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a</em>
                </p>
                <p><strong>LaTeX Format inside $$:</strong></p>
                <pre><code>$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Paste this LaTeX code into the editor or use the equation input field to add the formula. Your math equation will render perfectly.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="content-tables">
                <div class="latex-table-tips">
                    <h2>Adding Tables with LaTeX (KaTeX Supported)</h2>
                    <p>
                      Similar to adding math equations, you can also add tables using LaTeX (KaTeX supported). LaTeX tables provide a structured and professional way to display data in your document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Follow these steps to add a table using LaTeX:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Write your LaTeX table code as usual, but ensure it’s in a single line to avoid rendering issues.</li>
                      <li>Enclose the LaTeX code with <code>$</code> at the beginning and end of the code.</li>
                      <li>Paste the LaTeX code into the editor to render the table properly.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      A simple 2x2 table in LaTeX format:
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>LaTeX Format for the Table (Single Line):</strong></p>
                    <pre><code>
                  $ \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline a & b \\ \hline 1 & 2 \\ \hline 3 & 4 \\ \hline \end{array} $
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                      Once the LaTeX code is in a single line and enclosed in <code>$</code>, paste it into the editor. The table will be rendered as a neat, formatted structure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To create more complex tables, simply extend the LaTeX code with additional rows and columns. LaTeX tables offer various options for alignment and customization.

                <h2>Math and Table Tips</h2>
                <p>Here are some helpful tips for working with LaTeX equations and tables:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ensure Single Line for LaTeX:</strong> Always write LaTeX code for equations and tables in a single line. This helps avoid formatting issues in the editor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use $ for Inline Equations:</strong> To display an equation within a paragraph, enclose the LaTeX code in <code>$...$</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Using Ruled Paper:</strong> When inserting tables or equations, it's recommended not to use ruled paper, as it can create alignment issues. A blank background is better for these elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tables can be Nested:</strong> You can create nested tables by placing one table inside another. Just ensure that your LaTeX code remains properly structured.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preview Before Finalizing:</strong> Always preview your LaTeX equations and tables before generating the final handwritten document to ensure the formatting is correct.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Important Note:</strong></p>
                <p>
                You cannot directly edit LaTeX elements like equations or tables using the editor. To change LaTeX elements, such as adjusting the font color, bold, etc., you must modify the LaTeX code itself. The editor allows changes to visual styles (like font size, background, etc.), but the LaTeX content must be modified through LaTeX code directly.

                    <h3>How to Add Drawings or Images</h3>
                    <p>Learn how to enhance your handwritten documents by adding custom drawings or images effortlessly.</p>
                
                
                <div class="drawing-steps">
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <span class="step-number">1</span>
                        <h4>Switch to Drawing Mode</h4>
                        <p>Click on the <strong>"Switch to Drawing"</strong> button in the toolbar. This will turn your page into a canvas, allowing you to draw freely on the entire page. You can draw anywhere, including above the text or in the margins.</p>
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <span class="step-number">2</span>
                        <h4>Adjust the Canvas Size if needed</h4>
                        <p>You can adjust the size of the canvas as needed. The canvas has a border, which is not part of the page. Once you click the <strong>"Generate Image"</strong> button, this canvas border will automatically be removed.</p>
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <span class="step-number">3</span>
                        <h4>Method 1: Draw on the Entire Page (Including Margins and Text)</h4>
                        <p>To draw on the entire page, including the margins or areas above the text, adjust the text spacing on the page accordingly. Once the spacing is adjusted, you can freely draw on any part of the page where you want.

                            When you're done with your drawing, click the "Generate Image" button to create an image of the current page with your drawing. Please note that this drawing is temporary and applies only to the current page. Once generated, you'll be able to see your drawing on the final output.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h4>Method 2: Draw on the Main Page Only (Excluding Margins and Top of Text)</h4>
                        <p>If you don’t want to draw on the margins or the top of the text, you can use this method to draw only on the main page content area.</p>
                        <p>To do this, draw on the page and then click the <strong>"Add to Paper"</strong> button. You will see options to adjust the image's position relative to the text:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Left:</strong> The image will be placed on the left side of the page, with the text positioned on the right side of the image.</li>
                            <li><strong>Right:</strong> The image will be placed on the right side of the page, with the text positioned on the left side of the image.</li>
                            <li><strong>None:</strong> No specific position will be applied, and the text will remain as is.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can also adjust the image size .</p>
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="step-box">
                        <span class="step-number">5</span>
                        <h4>Make the drawing  Permanent part of paper</h4>
                        <p>When you click the <strong>"Add to Paper"</strong> button, the image becomes a permanent part of the page and will remain there until you reload the page. This means you don't need to generate the image immediately, and the image will remain in place.</p>
                        <p>If you want to change the position of the image later, you can do so by typing the label associated with each image (e.g., <strong>img1</strong>, <strong>img2</strong>) in the input editor. Wherever you type <strong>img1</strong>, the first image will appear in that position. This allows you to move the image around on the page easily.</p>

                    <h4>1. How do I resize the page to A4?</h4>
                    <p>The page is by default A4. However, on the screen, A4 does not mean the actual A4 size. It depends on how many lines of text you can create on that page. Its appearance defines its size. You can convert the page to any size using the resize option at the corners of the page.</p>

                    <p>There are many tools available on the internet. You can use any of them. For me, "High-Logic Font Creator" is the best tool. It is paid, but you can use its 30-day trial period, which is enough to create your font.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>5. Why is my custom font not aligned with the background lines?</h4>
                    <p>Every font has its own spacing and other properties, so you need to adjust the values according to that specific font.</p>
